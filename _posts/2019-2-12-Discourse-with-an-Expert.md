Soon after I wrote my last post (about two weeks ago), I posted my ideas on a message board.  I quickly got a reply from someone who knows a lot more than me about neuroscience (I assume he's either an expert or an extremely dedicated nerd).  Unsurprisingly, most often my original suppositions are wrong.  Here is the discussion:

***My Original Post:***

I recently came across this article (https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-sense-of-the-present-brains-may-predict-the-future-20180710/) about predictive coding and it gave me one of those moments where everything I thought about how the brain works "clicked". I'm no neuroscientist but I've been interested in neuroscience/psychology since middle school, and predictive processing seems to explain everything about the mechanism at the base of perception and cognition. Naturally, with this new framework, I decided to overgeneralise.

Some thoughts: 
I started thinking, consciousness arises from or is the same thing as general intelligence, the scope of which increases with an increase in cortical (and extremely plastic) neurons. Intelligence is just predictive power: as the number of processing layers (neurons) increase, the accuracy, error correction, and scope of predictions increases (thus more abstract predictions/reasoning can occur). Consciousness/intelligence is not past some boundary that humans have crossed, it is a smooth gradient that is the result of number of neurons. Self-awareness arises in social animals that have a large number of neurons out of necessity to achieve tasks that require role specialisation and distinction of individuals within the group.
Perception is the comparison between predictive models and external input; the margin of error is taken into account, used to create better models, and what we perceive is the prediction (or corrected prediction). Dreams are the result of a brain that is actively trying to perceive (via prediction) in the absence of external corrective cues. As a result, predictions made in dreams are pulled from memories and with the only corrective inputs coming from within, feedback loops cause overpredictions and a nonsensical dream "reality". Dreams feel "real" because the process underlying the generation of the dream reality is the same as in base reality. 

How wrong am I?

OK so to tackle these ideas, let's break it down into a few digestible statements, and see what predictions we can derive from them, if any, and if they hold up.
>consciousness arises from or is the same thing as general intelligence

You'd have to define consciousness first. Do you mean self-referential processing, stimulus awareness that is overtly reportable, etc? 
>Consciousness/intelligence is not past some boundary that humans have crossed, it is a smooth gradient that is the result of number of neurons.
>that is the result of number of neurons.

This is most likely unsupported by the evidence. There are animals (e.g. whales) that have a far larger number of neurons that humans do. If you look at cerebral organization, most neurons aren't even in the cortex but instead are there to support motor function (i.e. the cerebellum contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined). 
>a smooth gradient

Probably true, and it's also regarded as such in the literature, at least when it comes to general intelligence. Opinions differ when it comes to awareness, with some people (e.g. stan dehaene) considering it as a on/off phenomenon that requires intrinsic cortical ignition. 
>Self-awareness arises in social animals that have a large number of neurons out of necessity to achieve tasks that require role specialisation and distinction of individuals within the group.

Most *social* animals are relatively simple in terms of neural architecture (e.g. bees, ants). 
>Perception is the comparison between predictive models and external input
Sure, this is pretty much what modern predictive coding models propose (e.g. Friston's)
>Dreams are the result of a brain that is actively trying to perceive (via prediction)

If that's the case then we should dream during non-REM sleep (but we don't). Arguably sensory input is even further suppressed in those stages of sleep

I'm aware of the gaping holes in my knowledge but I'll try to explain some of my original reasoning.
>Consciousness/intelligence is not past some boundary that humans have crossed, it is a smooth gradient that is the result of number of neurons. 
>that is the result of number of neurons. 

I was aware that other animals (I think even some birds) had more neurons, so what I really meant was cortical neurons:
>the scope of which increases with an increase in cortical (and extremely plastic) neurons.

Even so, I think some animals outnumber humans in cortical neurons, so I'm thinking it more has to do with plasticity (perhaps "less intelligent" animals with more neurons simply have more specialisation and fewer "free" neurons for abstract reasoning). I'm aware this is unsupported.
>Self-awareness arises in social animals that have a large number of neurons out of necessity to achieve tasks that require role specialisation and distinction of individuals within the group.
>Most *social* animals are relatively simple in terms of neural architecture (e.g. bees, ants). 

I meant higher order social animals (primates, cetaceans, humans)
>Dreams are the result of a brain that is actively trying to perceive (via prediction)
>If that's the case then we should dream during non-REM sleep (but we don't). 

From what I've read, brain wave activity during REM is incredibly similar to that of waking states, while non REM sleep is markedly distinct from waking states. Thus I figured dream generation happens during REM when activity is most similar to wakefulness.
>Arguably sensory input is even further suppressed in those stages of sleep

I'm arguing that dreams don't require external sensory inputs, only internal inputs.

I know I'm making huge leaps, so I'm digging into the topic as much as I can. If you could point me towards some resources on cognitive neuroscience and predictive processing that would be greatly appreciated.

>Even so, I think some animals outnumber humans in cortical neurons (...).

The funny thing is that plasticity is a neural property that is evolutionary very much preserved across species. Much of what we know about the mechanisms of plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD) comes from the study of very simple animals like aplysia. It's not a bad hypothesis, but it unfortunately doesn't hold up.
>I meant higher order social animals (...)

My bad. In biology the term 'social' refers to a specific type of interaction in which individuals forego reproduction in order to help rear their siblings. These animals form colonies with a single queen that reproduces. But if you mean animals that show any non-zero degree of gregariousness, then I'm not sure to what extent we can derive any predictions here besides the one that these animals should show higher cortical plasticity. 
>From what I've read, brain wave activity during REM is incredibly similar to that of waking states, while non REM sleep is markedly distinct from waking states. Thus I figured dream generation happens during REM when activity is most similar to wakefulness.

This is all true (but note that REM sleep also shows characteristic markers that don't occur during wakefulness). 
>I'm arguing that dreams don't require external sensory inputs, only internal inputs.

Yes, I understood your proposal. But what I'm saying is that (compared to REM sleep) during non-REM sleep, there is proportionally even more internal input due to the complete absence of external input. If dreams result from intra-cortical prediction alone then we should as a result dream more during non-REM. 
>I know I'm making huge leaps, (...) If you could point me towards some resources on cognitive neuroscience and predictive processing that would be greatly appreciated.

No worries, I admire your enthusiasm and would be happy to stick around to flesh these ideas out a bit more. I'll post some more papers later (comment too long)

***Me:***

Thank you very much for your explanations and resources! If you don't mind, I have one more question: if not plasticity or number of neurons, do you have any ideas or resources as to why humans are so intelligent?

***Me:***

Don't mean to bother you, but another question: are there any studies linking dreams and predictive coding?

***Anon***

>if not plasticity or number of neurons, do you have any ideas or resources as to why humans are so intelligent?

It's likely to be not just one factor, but a combination of many. One needs neurons to perform computations of course, but speed of signal propagation matters too and that's where the encephalization quotient comes into play. The human brain is relatively compact compared to that of many other species with a large number of neurons, meaning the distances that neural signals need to travel across are smaller and information is exchanged more efficiently. Also, the topology of the human connectome is distinct from many other species in that there is a relatively high degree of intra-cortical connectivity in higher order associative brain areas that one needs for complex cognitive operations. In other words, our brains are wired slightly differently in the parts where it matters. Besides that, we have access to high caloric diets to power that big engine under the hood with relatively little cost in terms of fitness. 

I just did a quick search and found, besides a mountain of opinion pieces, the following:
https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/02/1501026112.short

It seems that there are lots of people hypothesizing a relationship between the sleep and prediction, but very little actual empirical work. This is due to the fact that both predictive computation and dreaming are notoriously difficult to study in humans (we do not have access to invasive recordings, and dreaming in particular is experimentally hard to control).

It didn't take me long to realise that the questions I pose require no less than expertise to answer, and that acquiring the knowledge just to attempt answering my most basic questions will take weeks of conscious effort.  Nonetheless, asking such overarching questions is how I plan to gain deep insights into cognitive neuroscience as well as the philosophical questions regarding cognition and perception.  My model is this: hypothesise, disprove/prove, refine my understanding, repeat.  I hope that eventually, if I continue this process I will arrive at a number of novel questions that have not yet been addressed.  Already I seem to have come across such a question; the question of whether predictive coding (and Friston's Free Energy principle) is the mechanism underlying dream generation is a prospective frontier.
