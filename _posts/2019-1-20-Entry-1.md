This site is a blog logging some of my thoughts, interests, and progress on personal projects.  Currently I am investigating genetically engineering yeast to express the human HCRT (hypocretin) gene, so it's likely that most of my posts will be biology related.  Other than my projects, I'll probably post some of my thoughts on philosophy, psychology, and science (mostly molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology).
